# Combat

## Concepts

### Positioning Dice

These Dice represent how well placed you are in the Combat.

You may spend any amount of them during your Action to Shift your Range by that amount respective to another Combatant.

You may also spend 1 Positioning Dice during an Attack or Defense in addition to any other dice you've committed. It is rolled as normal.

### Basic Attack - Brawl

Attack - Strength - Blunt - Weak - Range 0
Stagger -> Stagger -> Stagger -> Break

Everyone may use this Attack without a specific Skill.

### Basic Defense - Dodge

Defense - Spirit - Range Any

Everyone may use this Defense without a specific Skill.

## Phases of Combat

### Ranges

Check the Ranges that each combatant is from each other.

### The Test of Spirit

All combatants Roll Spirit. Successes will give them Positioning Dice.

### Initiative

Combat is resolved by order of Positioning Dice. Ties are resolved by roll-off.

### Action

When it is a combatant's turn, that combatant may take an Action if they haven't Defended yet this turn.
The Basic Actions are Attack, Reposition and Breathe.

#### Attack

A combatant chooses a target for his Attack, and declares any Skills he will use on it.
The target becomes the Defender and declares any Skills he will use on the Defense.

Both players secretly choose a number of Strength dice to Roll.
The dice are then revealed and rolled.
If the Attacker rolls more successes, each success becomes one Damage on the Defender.
If the Defender rolls more successes, he steals (if possible) one Positioning Dice from the Attacker for each success.

If the Attacker chose ZERO dice, the Defender gains nothing, and loses all committed Dice.
This is known as a Feint.

If the Defender chose ZERO dice, and the Attacker either chose ZERO dice or rolled no Successes, the Defender is considered to not have Defended yet this turn.

#### Reposition

Gain a Positioning Dice. The combatant may also attempt to roll Spirit for extra Positioning Dice per success.

#### Breathe

The combatant gains a Respite, restoring any Stagger damage as well as gaining 2 spent dice from each Stat.

### Again

Once all combatants have Acted (if possible) restart the combat at the Test of Spirit.
